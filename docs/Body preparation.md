## Body preparation ##

In cross-country skiing, you will be moving mostly on thre flat terrain. However, at times you will need to go up gentle the slopes. As such, this requires lots of energy, stamina, and speed control. This is one of the most demanding cardio activities in the world.

Therefore, you need to exercise both your stamina and your core strength. Also, do not forget about the appropriate fuel for you muscles so that you can make them grow.

To sum up, "all" you need to succeed is: cardio training,
working on your core and appropriate nutrition.

### Cardio training ###

Before you get on the trail, start doing your cardio to build endurance by running, biking, or even kayaking.

With time and practice, you may feel like taking up some HIIT trainings as well. You can easily achieve that by tossing in a few intervals in between. For instance, you could go hard for 30 seconds and then take a minute break in between or do a low-intensity activity â€“ such as brisk walking.

Also, activities such as hiking, trail running, biking, and even surfing can be excellent when cross-training for skiing. These can help build strength and power in the legs, improve cardiovascular fitness, and increase endurance. You will also learn how to read terrain and navigate obstacles when skiing.

Roller skiing is another form of dryland training that cross-country skiers can perform off-season. This will also help you practice techniques and improve your overall endurance. As you can see, there are skills that you can transfer from these activities that can be immensely helpful when skiing.

### Working on your core ###

While cardio helps you build endurance, you need your core to be strong as well in order to ski. The power of your propulsion comes from your abs and lower back; therefore, you will need to focus on strength exercises targeting these parts. Also, you need your core to be strong in order to ski.
