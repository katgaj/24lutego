### Base layers ###

*Base layers* are close-fitting garments that are often made of wool or polypropylene (fancy plastic). Some folks refer to these as long underwear.

 They wick moisture away from your skin and help you retain heat. They are lightweight, breathable, and allow for a full range of motion. Base layers are typically composed of wind briefs (wind blocking) or underwear, then a pair of leggings and a long sleeve top.

They donâ€™t have to be the most high-tech, however I would be cautious of picking out something too heavy. Heavy base layers can easily get saturated with sweat. Look for something made of a lightweight material, that breathes well, and is not made of cotton.
