### Middle layers ###

Your *mid-layer* typically is going to be a cross-country specific jacket, or a winter running jacket and a pair of cross-country pants. If you’re a cool cat, you could also ski in a wool sweater. 

Cross-country specific jackets and pants will often have ventilation near the back with wind blocking material in the front. Much like the base layers, you’ll want something that is lightweight and allows for a full range of motion. 

For an added layer of warmth, you should wear an insulated vest over your jacket.
