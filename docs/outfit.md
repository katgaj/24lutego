## Outfit ##

### Base layers ###

*Base layers* are close-fitting garments that are often made of wool or polypropylene (fancy plastic). Some folks refer to these as long underwear.

 They wick moisture away from your skin and help you retain heat. They are lightweight, breathable, and allow for a full range of motion. Base layers are typically composed of wind briefs (wind blocking) or underwear, then a pair of leggings and a long sleeve top.

They don’t have to be the most high-tech, however I would be cautious of picking out something too heavy. Heavy base layers can easily get saturated with sweat. Look for something made of a lightweight material, that breathes well, and is not made of cotton. 

### Middle layers ##

Your *mid-layer* typically is going to be a cross-country specific jacket, or a winter running jacket and a pair of cross-country pants. If you’re a cool cat, you could also ski in a wool sweater. 

Cross-country specific jackets and pants will often have ventilation near the back with wind blocking material in the front. Much like the base layers, you’ll want something that is lightweight and allows for a full range of motion. 

For an added layer of warmth, you should wear an insulated vest over your jacket.

### Outer layers ###

Your *outer layer* is going to be for your extra warm jacket, and occasionally your big snow pants. These should be big enough to fit over the other layers previously mentioned. 

The pants are really reserved for if you are on touring skis moving slowly, coaching at a race, or you’re doing a cooldown after your race.

### Head and neck ###

When skiing in truly cold conditions, any exposed skin can quickly show signs of frostbite.

Start with wearing a hat (or touque for our Canuck friends to the North).Your body loses about 10% of its heat through your head. Much like the base layer, aim to have a lightweight wool or polypropylene cap.

Cover your neck with a gaiter. Again, lightweight and breathable is the name of the game. 

### Hands and feet ###

Your hands and feet are particularly susceptible to the cold. 

The most important thing to keep your hands and feet warm is to maintain a warm torso. When your body gets cold, its first instinct is to pull blood away from the surface of the skin and extremities.

 To prevent this, keep your skin covered, and your torso warm.

For your hands, mittens are the way to go.
